# peakmoment
This code enables the extraction of spectra from JWST image cubes, identification of emission lines, and generation of continuum-subtracted moment-0 maps for each detected spectral peak. It uses publicly available JWST archive (https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/jwst) data to demonstrate the workflow.
